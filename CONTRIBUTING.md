## Markdown

Discord List uses [GitHub Markdown](https://docs.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github), as long as you pay attention to markup formats in a standard and simple shape, there is no problem.

[adam-p's Markdown Cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) is a fantastic tool of reference if you need to quickly learn about or refresh your memory of a Markdown feature.

we got help from [this](https://github.com/ppy/osu-wiki/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) place when editing this article.
